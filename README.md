# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

*** Objectives *** 

Replicate the dashboard UI exactly as per Figma.
Create an interactive task management system with features like adding, moving, and filtering tasks.
Apply Redux for state management and ensure persistence with Local Storage.
Deliver a deployable, production-ready React application.

*** Tools & Technologies *** 

Framework: React.js
→ Industry-standard, component-based, easy to scale for dashboards.

State Management: Redux
→ Centralized global state management, predictable, easy persistence.

Persistence: Local Storage
→ Lightweight browser-based storage, ensures tasks remain after refresh.

Optional Libraries:

@hello-pangea/dnd → For drag-and-drop task movement.
redux-persist → Simplifies Local Storage integration with Redux.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

# React Router for navigation
npm install react-router-dom

# Redux for state management
npm install redux react-redux

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
